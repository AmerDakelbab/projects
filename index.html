          <div class="second-whitel">"Before joining the bootcamp.i've never written a line of code. I needed some
            structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouarged to enroll by a
            former student of theris who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and
            staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and i never had to wait long for assistance. the agile
            team project,in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial
            could ever have. in fact,i've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent
            experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offer. 100%
            recommend! "</div>
